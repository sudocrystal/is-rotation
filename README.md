# is-rotation

Write a method `isRotation` that, given two strings, will determine if one string is a rotation of the other.

e.g. `isRotation("doghouse", "usedogho")` returns `true`

You can rotate the letters of "usedogho" to create "doghouse"

This is not a permutation problem.

e.g. `isRotation("dog", "dgo")` returns `false`

This is not a rotation even though the same letters are used exactly.
